you can supply one CNF and one DNF
they both take the same form
[ term, term, ... ]
for CNF this means term & term & term, ...
for DNF this means term | term | term

each term can be a positive assertion or a negative assertion or a list of assertions
a positive assertion is written "x==y"
a negative assertion is written "x<>y"
a list of assertions is written [ assertion, assertion, ... ]

for example [ "x==y", "a<>b", [ "x==a", "y<>b" ], ... ]
for CNF this means x==y & a<>b & (x==a | y<>b), ...
for DNF this means x==y | a<>b | (x==a & y<>b), ...

DNF is automatically translated into CNF using truth tables that consider all of the available options for all items in the dimensions used by the expression
